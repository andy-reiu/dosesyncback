‚ò¢Ô∏è DoseSync ‚Äì Backend v1

![HomeView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0168bd82-bac0-47ab-bf3f-b5cfeff6674e)
Planning of the patients in the Nuclear Department for better treatment and cost.
It allows one to plan today's or week's schedule - when to inject, how much to inject, and see how much remains after injection.
It also has calculations to improve the amount that can be injected.

![AdminView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b430a67-bddf-4925-9b6c-317ca2348c42)
There are user management, profile, and admin settings for calculation, hospital, and isotope management.
Additionally, DoseSync provides user management with two roles:  
- **Admins** (Doctors or Physicists) who can create and modify plans  
- **Technicians** who can view results only
Information then can be stored in the local database or saved as PDF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DoseSync includes a separate frontend application for managing schedules, dose planning, and user roles.
The frontend communicates with this backend via REST APIs, repository is available at:  
`https://github.com/andy-reiu/dosesyncfront`

DoseSync is built with Spring Boot and Java 21. 
This repository contains the server-side codebase that handles data storage, REST APIs, and application logic.
üöÄ Features
- Planning and optimization of nuclear medicine patient doses  
- Scheduling for daily or weekly injection plans  
- User management with Admin and Technician roles  
- Hospital, isotope, and calculation management by Admins  
- Data storage in PostgreSQL
- Export schedules and dose info as PDFs  
- REST API with validation and Swagger/OpenAPI docs  

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL / H2
- Swagger (OpenAPI 3)
- MapStruct
- Lombok

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Gradle (or use the wrapper)
- PostgreSQL (if not using H2)
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)

Getting Started

### Setup Database

1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `dosesync` (or your preferred name).  
2. Create a user and grant appropriate privileges.  
3. Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dosesync
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
```

üöÄ Roadmap

- Enhance authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT)  
- Add additional user roles with customized permissions  
- Implement a notification system to remind staff about scheduled injections  
- Develop a frontend application for easier interaction with the backend  
- Improve dose calculation algorithms for increased accuracy  
- Add detailed audit logging and activity tracking  
- Optimize performance for handling larger hospital datasets
